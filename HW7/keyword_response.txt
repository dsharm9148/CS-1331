javaJava is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle Corporation) in the mid-1990s. It is designed to be platform-independent, meaning that Java programs can run on any device or operating system that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed, without needing to be recompiled. Java is known for its "write once, run anywhere" (WORA) principle, which allows developers to create code that can run on multiple platforms without modification. This is achieved through the compilation of Java source code into bytecode, which is then executed by the JVM. Key features of Java include: Object-oriented: Java supports the principles of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, making it well-suited for building modular and reusable code. Platform independence: Java programs can run on any device or operating system that has a compatible JVM, including computers, servers, mobile devices, and embedded systems. Strongly typed: Java enforces strict type checking at compile-time, helping to catch errors early in the development process and improve code reliability. Automatic memory management: Java features a garbage collector that automatically manages memory allocation and deallocation, reducing the risk of memory leaks and simplifying memory management for developers. Rich standard library: Java comes with a comprehensive standard library (Java API) that provides ready-to-use classes and methods for common programming tasks, such as file I/O, networking, and GUI development. Java is widely used in various domains, including web development, mobile app development (Android), enterprise software development, scientific computing, and more. It continues to be one of the most popular programming languages due to its versatility, reliability, and large developer community.1331CS 1331 is an introductory course in computer science at the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech). It is titled "Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming" and is typically taken by students pursuing majors in computer science or related fields. In this course, students learn fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming using Java. Topics covered may include data types, control structures, methods, classes, inheritance, polymorphism, exception handling, file I/O, and basic GUI programming. CS 1331 serves as a foundation for further coursework in computer science at Georgia Tech, providing students with essential programming skills and a solid understanding of object-oriented principles. It is often a prerequisite for more advanced courses in the computer science curriculum.chatjptChatJPT is a goofy parody of ChatGPT posed as a homework to Spring 2024 CS 1331 students in Professor Stasko's section. We tried to use ChatGPT's API instead of this rule based thing, but it seems to unavoidably send error messages about being too busy. At least this works some of the time.javafxJavaFX is a UI framework designed with the primary purpose of tormenting intro Object-Oriented Programming students.recursionA recursive method is a method that makes calls to itself. To prevent infinite recursion, a recursive method should reach a base case in which it stops making recursive calls. Fibonacci and factorial are common examples of recursively defined problems that can be solved programmatically by evaluating a recursive method.polymorphismPolymorphism is one of five supposed pillars of Object-Oriented Programming. Summarized, it's the ability to treat something specific in general terms (e.g. treat a Dog as an Animal). It goes hand in hand with dynamic binding, as something specific being treated generally can satisfy general requirements in its own specific way.
